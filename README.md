# Bitconvo

Bitconvo is  an app that help displays the latest exchange rate between cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) and any of the 20 major world currency including Naira.
Also, it allows for conversion between the crytocurrencies and the world currencies.

Latest exchange rates were got by querying the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html">Crytocompare</a> API.
Heavy network request to the server was done using the Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html">Volley</a> library.

Below are some of the screenshots of the app's UI.
